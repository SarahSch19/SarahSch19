👋 Hi, I’m Sarah !

💻 I'm a junior full-stack developer. I've started learning with C++, moved on to C, then got on with whatever else was thrown at me. Nowadays, my projects are either apps with Java/Kotlin or web with JS-derivates, but I'm always happy to go back to lower languages, and I still haven't gotten into Cobol even though I've been thinking about it for ages.

🏢 I've joined InterSystems France in January 2021 (during Covid ), as a Technical Specialist based in Paris. Since then, I've worked mostly on TrakCare, whether it was client developments with ZEN reports or custom projects like the REST API for TrakCare.

📚 I love reading, wheter it's fantasy or sci-fi, and I'm also a writer when life doesn't get in the way. I've already managed to write four novels while studying, and still going on.

🌎 I adore traveling. I'm born Slovak and Polish, and often go to see my family still living in my home countries. I've lived in France, in Switzerland, in England and in South Korea... and I plan on visiting even more !
