👋 Hi, I’m Sarah !

 💻 I'm a young wanna be developer. I've started learning with C++, moved on to C, then got on with whatever else was thrown at me.
 Nowadays, my projects are either apps with Java/Kotlin or web with JS-derivates, but I'm always happy to go back to lower languages, and I still haven't gotten into Cobol even though I've been thinking about it for ages.

 📚 I love reading, wheter it's fantasy or sci-fi, and I'm also a writer when life doesn't get in the way.
 I've already managed to write four novels while studying, and still going on.

 💞️ @Nathan-dev-dot is probably my best collaborator, always such a pleasure to work with him on everything and nothing.
